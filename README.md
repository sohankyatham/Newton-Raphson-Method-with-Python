# Newton-Raphson-Method-with-Python

## Description
The Newton-Raphson Method (or Newton's Method) is an iterative numerical technique used to find the roots of a function. It starts with an initial guess and iteratively refines this guess until it approaches the roots of a function. The method is based on linear approximation and requires the calculation of both the function and its derivative. This project implements the Newton-Raphson Method in Python, providing a simple and efficient way to approximate square roots using this method.
